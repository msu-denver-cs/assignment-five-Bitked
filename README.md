I have learned how cool single page applications are. In a way they are almost simpler however becasuse of learning MVC prior, adjusting how I want the veiw to be has been more of a challenge . PWAs and there characteristics are facinating becasue of there characteristics as compared to MVC models. It is super cool to be able to have the current scripts working, although I am still messing around with using vue and more advanced single page applications. I understand the scripts that were given for us to use however I need to study up some more on what else I am able to modify and build on the current basic PWA.
