# README
I realized Immediately after connecting to GitHub classroom assignment-two how much I should have been using branches and squashing commits. On solo projects I donâ€™t care so much because I usually just use the final product once and then move on, however it is extremely annoying to look at all my small commits for project-one on project-two by copying same project. From now on I aim to keep everything much cleaner and less messy, for others to more easily read my progress and such.

The biggest thing I learned was how to assess the errors that come with testing and rail. Using rails docs were extremely helpful. Once I got the hang of how tests work in Rails it became and enjoyable process. Using selenium is a blast and I will start using it more and more for anything I want. Understanding where tests should be written and how to run them with rails commands as well as creating or using fixtures was cool to learn about. I look back at past projects and realize the major importance of TDD and reflected on what I can do differently with upcoming projects. Although there is still lots I can learn about more complicated rails functions, these few things gave me a great understanding of what development should look like and sparked some interests to use selenium for personal uses and learn more about scripts and logical expressions.
