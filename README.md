# README
I realized Imediately after connecting to GitHub classoom assignment-two how much I should have been using branches and squashing commits. On solo projects I dont care so much becasuse I usually just use the final product once and then move on, however it is extremely annoying to look at all my small commits for project-one on project-two by copying same project. From now on I aim to keep everything much cleaner and less messy, for others to more easily read my progress and such.
