# README
I realized Imediately after connecting to GitHub classoom assignment-two how much I should have been using branches and squashing commits. On solo projects I dont care so much becasuse I usually just use the final product once and then move on, however it is extremely annoying to look at all my small commits for project-one on project-two by copying same project. From now on I aim to keep everything much cleaner and less messy, for others to more easily read my progress and such.

Once I got the hang of how tests work in Rails it became and enjoyable process. Using selenium is a blast and I will start using it more and more for anything I want. The more I learn about testing the more I look back at past projects and reflect on what I can do better, to learn from them more. If this tool exists, I look forward to discoverying new tools possible makeing my own someday. Or more short term I would like to start learning more about scripts and loggical exressions.
